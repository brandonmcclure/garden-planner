# Garden Planner
[https://www.pennys-garden-planner.com/](https://www.pennys-garden-planner.com/)<br>
Design your own square-foot garden with ease.  Manipulating the layout is a breeze, and tasks such as determining seed/seedling arrangements or picking out companion plants are automatically handled for you.

### Background/Motivation
Square-foot gardening is a fun and effective way to grow your own food.  It's highly efficient and requires very little space, making it ideal for people who live in urban environments or who have limited mobility.  However, it can be difficult for many people to get past the planning phase. This garden designer aims to help with that.
